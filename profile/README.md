# Apex FOV Aimbot – Precision Aiming with Full Field Control 🔫📐

## Lock In. Lock On. Never Miss.

Apex Legends isn’t just about raw flicks—it’s about **precision tracking**, smart positioning, and being faster than the guy across from you. With the **Apex FOV Aimbot**, you don’t just aim—you lock in with surgical accuracy. This cheat lets you define exactly *how far* from your crosshair the bot locks in, creating a perfect balance between **legit-looking plays** and **laser-level accuracy**. 🎯⚡

Tired of missing fast movers? Want an aim assist that doesn’t get you banned? This is the move.

## 🧠 What Makes the FOV Aimbot Special?

Unlike basic rage aimbots that snap like aimbot.exe in a montage, the **FOV Aimbot** works by defining a field-of-view cone. It only locks onto targets within that cone, making your aim look way more human while still doing all the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

Perfect for stream-safe climbing, soft cheating in ranked, or going full auto-lock in pubs without looking obvious.
